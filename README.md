coding and miscelaneous tasks on eShop project

Hi Folks
i am a full beginner on GitHub (atom) web program. I am expected to get to learn the basics of php and html programming which would be necessary for an eCommerce project i have been doing. I therefor count a lot on online collaboration with experts of the community.
Staying tunned. Cheers
Eric
